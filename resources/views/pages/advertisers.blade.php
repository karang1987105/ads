    <p>
    We do our best to fit all expectations of our advertisers two of them
    are geotargeting and filtering. Geotargeting allows you to publish your advertisements only in countries chosen by you.
    Every country has its own price rate. Apart from that we offer the opportunity to filter and exclude Proxy and VPN traffic.
    These are still real human visits, the only thing is we cannot guarantee their actual geolocation. So if geolocation is
    absolutely important to you use this filter while creating an ad campaign.

    We use several security and filter methods against cheating and bots to provide our advertisers the best possible traffic.
    We are also very strict when we choose our publishers and try our best to provide real organic traffic only. Unwanted incentivized
    traffic is being blacklisted and ignored. All the traffic is 24 hours unique. That means your advertisemnts
    will be visible only once per day to the same person.

    or the Landscale 640x320 video format. Depending on the advertising format it's possible to choose between CPC (Cost Per Click),
    CPM (Cost Per Mille) or CPV (Cost Per View) measurements. Some formats or measurements may be more effective than others.
